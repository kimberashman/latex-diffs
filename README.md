# latex-diffs
This app determines if two texts are the same. 
I made this to help me determine if an edit has been made to a paragraph (if tracked changes were off).
Try it [here](https://kimberashman.com/projects/latex-diffs/index.html)

## To Do: 
* Highlight differences in paragraphs 
* Step through differences and decide which changes to keep 
* Output final paragraph
